## Credentials
Provide user credentials for autheticated pages

## APIs Used
If your application relies on external APIs, document them and include any necessary links or references.

Follow these steps to set up a JSON server for your project:

1. **Initialize npm**: Start by initializing a new npm project in your project directory:  npm init -y
 
2. **Install JSON Server**: Install JSON Server as a dependency in your project: npm install json-server
  

3. **Prepare Data File**: Create a JSON file to serve as your database. Make sure the file has a `.json` extension and contains your data in JSON format.

4. **Create Server Script**: Create a `server.js` file to define your JSON Server configuration and routes.

5. **Create .gitignore**: Create a `.gitignore` file and add `node_modules` to it to exclude the `node_modules` directory from version control.

6. **Define Start Script**: In your `package.json` file, add a `start` script to start the JSON Server:
``json
"scripts": {
  "start": "node server.js"
}

7. Add to Repository: Add your project files to your Git repository: git add .
8. Commit Changes: Commit your changes to Git: git commit -m "msg"
9. Push to Remote Repository: Push your changes to your remote Git repository: git push origin main
10. Use JSON Server: You can use JSON Server to serve your data by running the following command: npm start.

Create Webservice Option: If you want to host your JSON Server online, you can paste the GitHub code link in the appropriate option to generate a JSON server on your account.

That's it! You've now set up a JSON server for your project. You can access your JSON server by visiting http://localhost:3000.

In this project, we have used Render to create JSON server online.
